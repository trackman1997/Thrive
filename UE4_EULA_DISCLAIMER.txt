Unreal Engine 4 Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability
=======================================================

Thrive includes the Unreal® Engine code and other code, materials, and
information (the “Epic Materials”) from Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”).
All Epic Materials are provided on an “as is” and “as available”
basis, “with all faults” and without warranty of any kind.
Revolutionary Games Studio, Epic, and Epic’s affiliates disclaim all
warranties, conditions, common law duties, and representations
(express, implied, oral, and written) with respect to the Epic
Materials, including without limitation all express, implied, and
statutory warranties and conditions of any kind, such as title,
non-interference with your enjoyment, authority, non-infringement,
merchantability, fitness or suitability for any purpose (whether or
not Epic knows or has reason to know of any such purpose), system
integration, accuracy or completeness, results, reasonable care,
workmanlike effort, lack of negligence, and lack of viruses, whether
alleged to arise under law, by reason of custom or usage in the trade,
or by course of dealing.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Revolutionary Games Studio, Epic, and Epic’s affiliates
make no warranty that (1) any of the Epic Materials will operate
properly, including as integrated in the Thrive, (2) that the Epic
Materials will meet your requirements, (3) that the operation of the
Epic Materials will be uninterrupted, bug free, or error free in any
or all circumstances, (4) that any defects in the Epic Materials can
or will be corrected, (5) that the Epic Materials are or will be in
compliance with a platform manufacturer’s rules or requirements, or
(6) that a platform manufacturer has approved or will approve this
Thrive, or will not revoke approval of this Thrive for any or no
reason.  Any warranty against infringement that may be provided in
Section 2-312 of the Uniform Commercial Code or in any other
comparable statute is expressly disclaimed by Revolutionary Games
Studio and Epic.  Revolutionary Games Studio, Epic, and Epic’s
affiliates do not guarantee continuous, error-free, virus-free, or
secure operation of or access to the Epic Materials.  This paragraph
will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither
Revolutionary Games Studio, Epic, Epic’s licensors, nor its or their
affiliates, nor any of Revolutionary Games Studio’s or Epic’s service
providers, shall be liable in any way for loss or damage of any kind
resulting from the use or inability to use the Epic Materials or
otherwise in connection with this [Agreement], including but not
limited to loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure, or
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.  In no
event will Revolutionary Games Studio, Epic, Epic’s licensors, nor its
or their affiliates, nor any of Revolutionary Games Studio’s or Epic’s
service providers be liable for any loss of profits or any indirect,
incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, or
any other damages arising out of or in connection with this
[Agreement] or the Epic Materials, or the delay or inability to use or
lack of functionality of the Epic Materials, even in the event of
Revolutionary Games Studio’s, Epic’s, or Epic’s affiliates’ fault,
tort (including negligence), strict liability, indemnity, product
liability, breach of contract, breach of warranty, or otherwise and
even if Revolutionary Games Studio, Epic or Epic’s affiliates have
been advised of the possibility of such damages.  These limitations
and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to
provide adequate compensation.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the
limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in
such states or jurisdictions, the liability of Revolutionary Games
Studio, Epic, Epic’s licensors, its and their affiliates, and any of
Revolutionary Games Studio’s or Epic’s service providers shall be
limited to the full extent permitted by law.
